*Treehouse Full Stack Javascript Tech Degree - Project 6*

This is my 6th project on the full stack javascript tech. degree path, and a great introduction to building applications with Node.js and Express. This simple project  Fun project, and a good introduction to:

- *Express* - Using express for basic routing, error handling, and returning data.
- *JSON* - Parsing some JSON and generating dynamic HTML content.
- *Foundation* - An introduction to the Foundation front-end framework, which I had always been curious about.

Project files can easily be cloned and run locally in your browser. Just make sure you have *Node* installed and run `node install` to install the required packages, and use `nodemon app.js` to get the site up and running.
