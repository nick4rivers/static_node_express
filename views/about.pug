            | Welcome to the site! I'm Nick, and I'm a full stack web developer that's happy geeking out in javascript, rails, or maybe just messing with CSS. Beyond that, I've got a whole other set of expertise using R and Python to answer data-driven questions, and a background in statistics, data analysis, and data visulization. Whether it's the ESRI environment or open source technologies like Q, I also enjoy analysis and display of spatial data using. Thanks for stopping by....
